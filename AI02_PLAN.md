# AI-02: Automated Project Analysis Plan

## Objective
Develop and integrate automated project analysis features into VentAI to provide actionable insights, compliance checks, and optimization recommendations using AI algorithms.

## Scope
- **Algorithm Development**: Create algorithms for analyzing project data, focusing on ventilation system design parameters.
- **Integration**: Embed these algorithms into the existing project management framework of VentAI.
- **User Interface**: Enhance the Project Management and AI Dashboard pages to display analysis results and recommendations.
- **Compliance and Optimization**: Ensure the AI provides checks against industry standards and suggests optimizations for cost, efficiency, and performance.

## Key Features
1. **Automated Analysis Trigger**:
   - Automatically initiate analysis when a project is updated or manually triggered by the user.
   - Support for batch analysis of multiple projects.
2. **Compliance Checking**:
   - Compare project parameters against a database of industry standards and regulations.
   - Highlight non-compliant areas with detailed explanations.
3. **Optimization Recommendations**:
   - Suggest alternative materials, configurations, or designs for cost reduction or performance improvement.
   - Provide estimated savings in terms of cost, time, and resources.
4. **Insightful Reporting**:
   - Generate concise reports with visual aids (charts, graphs) for easy understanding.
   - Allow export of reports in PDF or CSV formats.
5. **Integration with Project Management**:
   - Display analysis results within the Project Detail view and AI Dashboard.
   - Enable users to act on recommendations directly from the interface (e.g., apply suggested changes).

## Technical Approach
- **Data Input**:
  - Extract project data from existing database models, focusing on design specifications and parameters.
  - Allow for manual input or upload of additional data if needed.
- **Algorithm Design**:
  - Use machine learning models to predict optimal configurations based on historical project data.
  - Implement rule-based systems for compliance checks against static standards.
- **Backend Integration**:
  - Develop new API endpoints for analysis requests and results retrieval.
  - Use asynchronous processing for long-running analysis tasks to prevent UI blocking.
- **Frontend Integration**:
  - Update `ProjectDetailPage` to show analysis results and recommendations.
  - Enhance `AIDashboard` to include a section for batch analysis results.
  - Use Chakra UI components for visual representation of data (e.g., charts with `recharts`).
- **Feedback Loop**:
  - Allow users to provide feedback on AI suggestions to improve future recommendations.

## Development Phases
1. **Research and Design** (1 week):
   - Study existing project data structures and AI analysis capabilities.
   - Design algorithm logic for compliance and optimization.
2. **Backend Development** (2 weeks):
   - Implement analysis algorithms and API endpoints.
   - Set up asynchronous task processing with status updates.
3. **Frontend Development** (2 weeks):
   - Update UI components to display analysis results.
   - Implement user interaction for triggering analysis and applying recommendations.
4. **Testing and Iteration** (1 week):
   - Test accuracy of analysis against known project outcomes.
   - Gather user feedback on UI and recommendation usefulness.
5. **Deployment and Documentation** (1 week):
   - Deploy features to production.
   - Update project documentation and user guides.

## Success Criteria
- AI analysis completes within acceptable timeframes (under 1 minute for typical projects).
- Compliance checks accurately identify at least 95% of known issues based on test data.
- Optimization recommendations are actionable and lead to measurable improvements in at least 80% of test cases.
- User interface is intuitive, with positive feedback on usability from initial testers.

## Dependencies
- Existing project management data models and APIs.
- AI backend infrastructure for processing and model execution.
- Chakra UI and related libraries for frontend enhancements.

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Risk**: Analysis algorithms may not cover all edge cases.
  - **Mitigation**: Start with a focused set of parameters and iteratively expand based on user feedback.
- **Risk**: Performance issues with large datasets.
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize algorithms and use pagination for result display.
- **Risk**: User adoption of AI recommendations may be low.
  - **Mitigation**: Ensure transparency in AI decision-making (explain why recommendations are made) and provide easy ways to apply changes.

## Next Steps After Approval
- Begin Research and Design phase, focusing on algorithm logic.
- Update `MASTER_PLAN.md` to reflect the start of AI-02.
- Commit planning document to repository for reference.

This plan aims to enhance VentAI with automated project analysis, making it a more intelligent tool for ventilation system design and management.
