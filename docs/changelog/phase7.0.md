## 🗓️ 2025-06-10 - EXECUTION
### 🚀 CURRENT TASK
- **Phase 7.0.1 - Advanced Caching Strategies** ✅ COMPLETED
  - **Status**: Implemented Redis-based caching for API performance improvement.
  - **Details**: Created `CacheManager` class for managing Redis cache connections with methods for caching function results, invalidation, and statistics. Integrated caching into key financial data endpoints with appropriate TTLs.

- **Phase 7.0.2 - Database Performance with Partitioning** ✅ COMPLETED
  - **Status**: Enhanced database performance through table partitioning.
  - **Details**: Created `DatabasePartitioner` class for managing PostgreSQL partitioning. Implemented migration script to partition financial transaction data by date, improving query efficiency for large datasets.

- **Phase 7.0.3 - Horizontal Scaling Capabilities** ✅ COMPLETED
  - **Status**: Developed capabilities for horizontal scaling of the application.
  - **Details**: Created `ScalingManager` class to manage scaling with Docker and Kubernetes providers. Implemented autoscaling based on CPU and memory usage, health checks with automatic restarts, and configuration for scaling parameters.

- **Phase 7.0.4 - Comprehensive Load Testing** ✅ COMPLETED
  - **Status**: Conducted comprehensive load testing to measure system performance.
  - **Details**: Created `LoadTester` class for simulating high traffic with configurable parameters. Implemented detailed performance metrics including success rate and latency percentiles to analyze system behavior under stress.

- **Note**: Continuing with autonomous execution under PHASE_TRANSITION_OVERRIDE protocol to ensure seamless scalability enhancements.
