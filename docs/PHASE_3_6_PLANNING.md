# Phase 3.6 Planning - Enterprise Security and Compliance Enhancements

## Overview
Phase 3.6 focuses on enhancing security measures and ensuring compliance with enterprise standards for VentAI Enterprise. This phase will introduce advanced security features, audit logging, and compliance reporting to safeguard data and meet regulatory requirements.

## Planned Features

### 3.6.1 - Advanced Security Features
- **Objective**: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA), role-based access control (RBAC) enhancements, and encryption for data at rest and in transit.
- **Components**:
  - MFA setup and management interface.
  - RBAC policy editor for fine-grained access control.
  - Encryption key management system.
- **Frontend**:
  - Create `SecuritySettings.js` for security configurations.
- **State Management**:
  - Create `securitySlice.js` with async thunks for managing security settings.

### 3.6.2 - Audit Logging and Monitoring
- **Objective**: Develop comprehensive audit logging for user actions and system events, with real-time monitoring dashboards.
- **Components**:
  - Audit log viewer with filtering and search capabilities.
  - Real-time monitoring dashboard for security events.
- **Frontend**:
  - Create `AuditLogViewer.js` for log management.
  - Create `SecurityMonitoring.js` for real-time dashboards.
- **State Management**:
  - Update `securitySlice.js` with async thunks for logs and monitoring data.

### 3.6.3 - Compliance Reporting and Management
- **Objective**: Provide tools for generating compliance reports and managing regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
- **Components**:
  - Compliance report generator with templates for various standards.
  - Management interface for tracking compliance status and actions.
- **Frontend**:
  - Create `ComplianceManager.js` for compliance tasks.
- **State Management**:
  - Update `securitySlice.js` with async thunks for compliance data.

## Dependencies
- **Phase 3.1 - Enterprise Integration**: Leverage existing authentication frameworks for MFA and RBAC.
- **Phase 3.4 - Enterprise Analytics**: Use analytics for security monitoring insights.
- **Backend Support**: Assumed API endpoints for security settings (`/api/security/*`), audit logs (`/api/audit/*`), and compliance data (`/api/compliance/*`).

## Timeline
- **Start Date**: 2025-06-12 (tentative)
- **Estimated Duration**: 3-4 days per task, total ~10-12 days
- **Completion Target**: 2025-06-24 (tentative)

## Success Criteria
- **Functionality**: All planned features implemented and operational.
- **Testing**: Unit and integration test coverage >80%, all tests passing.
- **Performance**: API response times <100ms, normal memory usage.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive updates to `CHANGELOG.md`, phase logs, and status reports.

## Next Steps After Planning Approval
1. Begin implementation of Phase 3.6.1 - Advanced Security Features.
2. Update project documentation to reflect Phase 3.6 planning.
3. Communicate readiness for Phase 3.6 execution.

**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ PENDING - Awaiting confirmation to proceed with Phase 3.6 implementation.
