# Wireframe to Implementation Gaps

This document identifies gaps between the wireframes in `frontend/docs/Dashboard_Wireframe.md` and `frontend/docs/Calculators_Wireframe.md` and the implemented React components in `frontend/src/pages/` for TASK-ID-005.

## Dashboard Wireframe Gaps
- **Project Overview Section**: The wireframe includes a section for project statistics and overview, which is not fully implemented in `DashboardPage.tsx`. Missing elements include project status indicators and detailed metrics.
- **Recent Activity Feed**: The wireframe suggests a feed of recent user activities or project updates, which is not present in the current implementation of `DashboardPage.tsx`.

## Calculators Wireframe Gaps
- **Advanced Calculation Tools**: The wireframe describes tools for complex calculations (e.g., cost-benefit analysis, ROI calculators), which are not fully implemented in `CalculatorsPage.tsx`. Only basic calculator components are present.
- **Saved Calculations History**: The wireframe includes a feature to view and manage past calculations, which is missing from the current `CalculatorsPage.tsx`.
