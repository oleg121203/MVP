## Explanation of Wireframe Elements

1. **Header Section**: Maintains consistency with `MainLayout`, providing navigation to key areas. Includes language and theme toggles for accessibility and personalization.
2. **Hero Section**: Designed to grab attention with a bold headline and subheadline that clearly state VentAI’s value proposition. Two CTAs encourage immediate engagement (sign-up or learning more via a demo).
3. **Capabilities Overview**: Highlights VentAI’s core features in a visually digestible grid. Each card uses an icon for quick recognition, a concise title, and a brief description to inform users of the platform’s strengths.
4. **Guided Onboarding Section**: Targets new users with a low-commitment offer to learn the platform quickly, reducing the learning curve and increasing adoption.
5. **Footer Section**: Standard informational links and branding to close the page, ensuring users can find additional resources or contact support.

This wireframe serves as a conceptual foundation for the homepage redesign. It can be translated into visual mockups using design tools like Figma or Sketch for further refinement and stakeholder feedback.

**Next Steps**:
- Review and iterate on this wireframe based on team feedback.
- Create visual mockups to finalize the design.
- Plan implementation in the frontend codebase, updating `HomePage.tsx`.
