# Locales Structure

- All global translation keys (including Duct Area Calculator) are now merged into the `common` section of `en.json` and `ua.json`.
- Keys are sorted alphabetically for easier maintenance.
- Calculator-specific keys are prefixed where necessary to avoid conflicts.
- Remove `src/translations/` directory after migration is complete.
