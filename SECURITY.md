## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Code Review**: All code must be reviewed before merging
2. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities
3. **Secrets**: Never commit secrets, API keys, or passwords
4. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input
5. **Authentication**: Use strong authentication mechanisms
6. **Authorization**: Implement proper access controls

### For Deployment

1. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
2. **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for configuration
3. **Database Security**: Use encrypted connections and strong passwords
4. **Network Security**: Implement proper firewall rules
5. **Monitoring**: Set up security monitoring and alerting
6. **Backups**: Maintain secure, encrypted backups

## Security Tools

We use the following security tools:

- **Trivy**: Container and filesystem vulnerability scanning
- **Snyk**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **OWASP Dependency Check**: Additional dependency analysis
- **CodeQL**: Static code analysis
- **ESLint Security Plugin**: JavaScript security linting

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Response**: Isolate affected systems
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Containment**: Stop the incident from spreading
4. **Recovery**: Restore systems and data
5. **Lessons Learned**: Document and improve processes
