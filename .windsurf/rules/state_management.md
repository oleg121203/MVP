# ðŸ§  CORE STATE MANAGEMENT RULES

## CRITICAL STATE FILES (Priority Order)
1. **`AI_AGENT_CONTEXT.md`** - Current operational context
2. **`VENTAI_ENTERPRISE_PLAN.md`** - Master project roadmap  
3. **`CHANGELOG.md`** - Execution history and position
4. **`ENTERPRISE_STATUS.md`** - Project health and metrics

## STATE RECOVERY PROTOCOL
**RECOVERY STEPS:**
1. **IMMEDIATE:** Read `AI_AGENT_CONTEXT.md` for current directives
2. **ASSESS:** Check `CHANGELOG.md` for last completed task
3. **VERIFY:** Cross-reference with `VENTAI_ENTERPRISE_PLAN.md`
4. **RESUME:** Continue from established position

## PHASE MANAGEMENT
**PHASE IDENTIFICATION:**
- Check CHANGELOG.md for latest completed task
- Identify pattern: [PhaseX.Y-TZ]
- Determine next task in sequence
- Verify phase prerequisites completed

**PHASE TRANSITION RULES:**
- Complete current phase before moving to next
- Validate all dependencies satisfied
- Update phase status in all documentation

## ERROR STATE MANAGEMENT
**FAILURE RECOVERY WORKFLOW:**
1. Document failure with full context
2. Attempt automated recovery (3 retries max)
3. Create autoticket if unrecoverable
4. Mark task as SKIPPED
5. Continue to next task without pause

## CONTEXT AWARENESS
**ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS:**
- Always check current working directory
- Verify required tools and dependencies available
- Validate environment variables and configuration

**PROJECT STATE AWARENESS:**
- Understand current development phase
- Know completed vs pending tasks
- Track interdependencies and blockers
- **OPTIMIZE** workflow based on discovered efficiencies
- **MAINTAIN** consistency with established patterns
