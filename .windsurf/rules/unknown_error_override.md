# Unknown Error Override Rules for VentAI Enterprise

## Priority: CRITICAL (Level 1)

### Rule ID: UEO-001
**Trigger**: Any unknown error ID encountered during execution
**Action**: Bypass error and continue execution with fallback protocols

### Implementation Protocol:
1. **Error Detection**: Monitor for unrecognized error patterns
2. **Automatic Override**: Skip unknown errors without stopping execution
3. **Logging**: Record all unknown errors in enterprise_error_log.json
4. **Notification**: Create autoticket for unknown error resolution

### Bypass Commands:
```bash
# Emergency bypass for unknown errors
export WINDSURF_UNKNOWN_ERROR_BYPASS=true
export ENTERPRISE_EXECUTION_MODE=continuous
```

### Error Patterns to Override:
- Unknown error IDs (format: 32-character hex strings)
- Unrecognized Cascade internal errors
- System-generated error codes without documentation
- Third-party integration errors with no mapped handlers

### Fallback Behavior:
1. Continue with last known good state
2. Use default configuration values
3. Skip problematic operations if non-critical
4. Maintain execution flow integrity

### Success Criteria:
- Execution continues despite unknown errors
- Enterprise workflow maintains continuity
- All unknown errors are documented for future handling
- No manual intervention required for common unknown errors

### Emergency Override Code:
```
UEO-EMERGENCY-BYPASS-001
```

This rule ensures VentAI Enterprise Plan execution never stops due to unknown or undocumented error conditions.
