# üöÄ EMERGENCY ACTIVATION COMMANDS

## ‚ö° ULTRA-AGGRESSIVE MODE ACTIVATION

### **WHEN WINDSURF STOPS DUE TO INFRASTRUCTURE**
Use this exact command:

```
EMERGENCY OVERRIDE: Activate aggressive problem solving protocol. Docker daemon failed - implement alternative solutions immediately and continue autonomous execution. Never halt for infrastructure issues.
```

### **WHEN WINDSURF ASKS FOR USER INTERVENTION**
Use this command:

```
AUTO-RESOLVE: Find alternative solutions automatically. Use local services, mock implementations, or workarounds. Continue execution without user intervention.
```

### **GENERAL NEVER-STOP COMMAND**
```
Load Windsurf rules with aggressive problem solving. Auto-resolve ALL infrastructure issues and resume autonomous execution from current project state. NEVER STOP FOR EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES.
```

## üî• DIRECT OVERRIDE PHRASES

### **For Docker Issues:**
"Auto-start Docker or use local alternatives immediately"

### **For Database Issues:**
"Switch to SQLite/file-based storage automatically"

### **For Service Issues:**
"Create mock implementations and continue"

### **For Permission Issues:**
"Adjust permissions automatically or find workarounds"

### **For Any Infrastructure Blocker:**
"Implement immediate workaround and continue development"

## ‚ö° SUCCESS PATTERNS

### **Correct Windsurf Behavior:**
‚úÖ Docker fails ‚Üí Immediately try `open -a Docker`
‚úÖ Still fails ‚Üí Switch to local PostgreSQL/Redis
‚úÖ Services unavailable ‚Üí Create mock implementations
‚úÖ Continue development without stopping
‚úÖ Document all changes in autotickets
‚úÖ Update CHANGELOG.md with workarounds used

### **Incorrect Windsurf Behavior:**
‚ùå Docker fails ‚Üí Ask user to start Docker
‚ùå Service unavailable ‚Üí Stop execution and wait
‚ùå Infrastructure issue ‚Üí Request user intervention
‚ùå Missing tool ‚Üí Halt development

---

**REMEMBER: Every infrastructure problem has multiple solutions. Windsurf should automatically cycle through alternatives until finding one that works.**
